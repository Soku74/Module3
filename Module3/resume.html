        <h2>Strengths and Weakness</h2>
        <p>My biggest strengths are my ability to work well in a team, align my goals with the company when working on assignments, complete assignments on time, and ask questions concerning the customer's concerns.My biggest weakness would probably be working independently while keeping myself on task. To fix such an issue I will have reminders on my phone go off every few or so minutes to keep myself on task. I would also break up the assessment that was given to me into smaller chunks and complete them for the day until completion.</p>

          <p>One project of mine would be my Self-hosted and modded Minecraft city server, which is about 6 years old. The plan for this project would be to host a server on a local computer within my home with some back-end code running in a Linux environment.</p>
